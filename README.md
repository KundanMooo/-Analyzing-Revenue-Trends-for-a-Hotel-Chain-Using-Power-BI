Insights 


#1. Update Hotel Appearance:
Make sure the hotel's website correctly depicts the real experience. If the hotel appears different in reality compared to the online,
guests can cancel or not show up. Align images and details to minimize disappointment. About 30% of consumers who confirm appointments don't show up.
To handle this, consider measures like prepayment or strict cancellations. Sending reminders might also minimize vacant rooms.

#2. Optimize Pricing: 
Adjust prices dynamically based on demand and competition. It can help optimise earnings from numerous booking systems.
Look at when average daily revenue is highest and explore similar strategies for other platforms.

#3.Improve Ratings for Better Occupancy:
Higher ratings typically indicate more guests. Focus on giving exceptional service, correcting negative comments,
and increasing overall ratings. Positive ratings attract more bookings and enhance income.

#4.Increase Sellable Rooms:
Analyze the constant amount of sellable rooms each night. Optimize room inventory management, such as through promotions or
changing bookings, to improve sellable rooms and income.

#5.Utilize unoccupied Resources:
With 42% of the hotel property unoccupied, seek strategies to enhance occupancy.
Run targeted marketing efforts, special deals, or collaborations to attract more guests and fill those empty rooms.

#6.Enhance Customer Preference:
As guests might think of the hotel as their second choice, due to 70% realization, understand why.
Collect feedback using surveys to find areas for improvement. Make the hotel a preferred choice by resolving complaints and giving a fantastic experience.

#7.Focus on Profitable Platforms:
Even if the realization rate is 70%, the largest profit comes from specialised booking platforms.
Understand why and invest in visibility, marketing, and pricing strategies for those platforms to optimise profitability.
